Storage
//Overview
Storage is technology that allows user to retain digital data.
Volatile vs Non- Volatile
Volatile = RAM / storage is erased when system power is turned off or interrupted
Non-Volatile = Permanent storage; Ex: Hard drive, flash memory and ROM
RAID Levels:
RAID 0 : Data is written on 2 or more drivers (high speed)
RAID 1 : Data is mirrored identically two drives (slow speed)
RAID 5 : Block level requires 3 drives with 1 disk failure
RAID 6 : Extension of RAID 5 requires 4 drives with 2 disk failures
RAID 1 + 0 : Hybrid; two stripped sets of disk then mirroring 
NAS= Network Attached storage is additional storage in a network
SAN= Storage Area Networking a raw block address level storage
//Cloud storage
Cloud storage is a third-party vendor that operates data storage servers via the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
The cost of ownership, time to deployment, and information management are just a few of the advantages of cloud storage.
